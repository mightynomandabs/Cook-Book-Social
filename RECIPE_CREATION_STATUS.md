## 🎯 **Recommendation**

**Start with Phase 1 (Essential Tables Only)** - This gives you a fully functional recipe creation and display system with just 4 tables. You can add the other 15 tables later as you implement more features.

The current setup provides:
- ✅ Complete recipe creation workflow
- ✅ Database persistence
- ✅ Recipe display in feeds
- ✅ All core functionality working

**Total Tables Needed for Basic Recipe App: 4 out of 19 (21%)**
